        <h2>Initial use</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          An individual's first drug use may be for a variety of reasons. An
          individual may be pressured by family and friends to try the drug or
          might think its cool due to cultural promotions. The chance of
          developing an addiction varies among different people.

        <h2>Abuse</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This is when an individual starts to use the drug on a recurring basis
          (not regularly yet) and in a way that is harmful. One example is the
          occasional use of heroine or smoking marijuana at a couple parties.
          The effects of the drug are different among different people, so drug
          levels that are considered abuse varies.

        <h2>Tolerance</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Tolerance is when the brain changes in response to the drug. This
          means that people will have to change the dosage in order to recieve
          the original physical and mental effect. Over time, this could create
          heavy abuse and severe symptoms.

        <h2>Dependence</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          This is when the individual becomes dependent on the substance. This
          means that they need the substance in order to function properly.
          Often this means that they will not be able to feel pleasure without
          the drug (anhedonia). This doesn't always diagnosed as addiction,
          however.
